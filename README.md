# SPACESHIPS

Shooty death fun!  Splosions!  Colory spaceships!

## Setup:

(You'll need [Node.JS](http://nodejs.org/) installed)

Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:SomeKittens/SPACESHIPS.git

Install the things:

    npm install

Run it:

    npm start

Browse to http://localhost:8080 and play!  It'll be pretty lonely solo.  Go find some mates and play live at http://spaceships-game.herokuapp.com/
